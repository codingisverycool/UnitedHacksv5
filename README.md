MoodCast Idle is a Chrome extension that rewards users with XP (experience points) for simply using their browser. As you gain XP and level up, you unlock new entertainment based on your chosen mood. Whether you're feeling **chill**, **curious**, **chaotic**, or something else, the extension adapts to match your vibe. 

The extension features:
- A real-time **XP tracker**
- An **upgrade system** that increases XP gain
- **Level-based background music** that evolves with your progress
- A **mood menu** that unlocks curated videos, games, and websites
- **Mini-games** that bring quick fun right inside the popup
- Mood-based **background color themes** for immersive vibes

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Earn XP Automatically**  
   From the moment you open your browser, you begin earning XP every second. As you purchase upgrades, the XP rate increases exponentially.

2. **Level Up**  
   As your XP grows, you level up. Each new level changes the background music and unlocks more features.

3. **Buy Upgrades**  
   Use your XP to buy upgrades that double your XP rate, making it easier to level up faster.

4. **Select Your Mood**  
   At each 6th level milestone, a new mood is unlocked. Moods include Chill, Curious, Energetic, Reflective, Chaotic, and Bored.  
   Each mood offers curated suggestions like:
   - Playlists
   - Websites
   - Videos
   - Mini-games

5. **Mood Suggestions**  
   Based on your current mood and level, youâ€™ll get a list of fun and relevant content. Higher levels unlock more suggestions per mood.

6. **Customization**  
   Each mood changes the color theme of the popup, and you can play mini-games like memory flips, reaction tests, trivia, and more!
